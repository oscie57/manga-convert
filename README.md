## Converts `.CBZ` to `.PDF`
To be fair, it's in the subtext. It converts your `.CBZ` files to `.JPG` and then to `.PDF`. It doesn't have to be manga, it can be anything, I just tested this using manga.

## How to use
### `manga.py`
This one is really simple since its just one file. Heres how:
1. Place your `.CBZ` file into the root directory.
2. Rename it to `in.cbz`
3. Run the script!

After a little while it should show up
